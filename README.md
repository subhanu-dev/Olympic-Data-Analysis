## 120 Years of Olympic Games Data Analysis (1896-2016) üèÖ

My goal from this project was to perform a thorough analysis on Olympics Games data spanning 120 from 1896 to 2016. with over 200,000 contestant records, this dataset brings many insights in to the largest sporting event in the world. My initial exploratory data analysis was done on the jupyter notebook using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. <br> view the notebook : [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/subhanu-dev/Olympic-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Olympic%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

Several preprocessing steps were taken to make sure it was ready for plotting. 
I have detailed all steps in the jupyter notebook with critical analytics on how the data varies for Olympic seasons, trends overtime, gender based analytics and best performing athletes of all time. I also wanted to see Sri Lankans who've been to Olympics. 

After doing thorough EDA on the dataset, I also wanted to present some of the key plots that visualize major insights from the data. For that, I've built an interactive Streamlit dashboard to interactively visualize these findings.
